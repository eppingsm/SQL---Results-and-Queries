#Create a count of the appearance of different categories in the dataset
#The following code is a set of basic commands in SQL necessary for changing category names, deleting irrelevant information from data 
#frames or renaming poorly named sections

SELECT name, category_id
FROM category 

#Insert a category into the list 
INSERT INTO category(name, category_id)
VALUES('War',21)

#Create a category Table
(category_id integer NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval('category_category_id_seq'::regclass),
#NOT NULL does not allow for a 0 value, integer – the value must be an integer
  name text COLLATE pg_catalog."default" NOT NULL,
#COLLATE: sorts the order of the data, text – it is character based not integer based, NOT NULL does not allow for a simple 0
  last_update timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
timestamp: provides a stamp with the time of recording, NOT NULL – no zeros
  CONSTRAINT category_pkey PRIMARY KEY (category_id)
);
PRIMARY KEY – makes category_id our main identifier in this table

#Update Names of a Category 
UPDATE film_category
SET category_id = 14
WHERE film_id = 5

#Delete a section of the dataset 
DELETE from category
WHERE name = 'Mystery'
