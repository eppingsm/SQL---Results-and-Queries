#How to Select Specific Columns and Understanding Query Costs
SELECT DISTINCT film_id,
                title
FROM film
#cost is 69.00 as opposed to 113.83 if we were to select the whole set

#Query for Sorting the Output
SELECT film,
       release_year,
	   rental_rate
FROM film
ORDER BY film ASC, 
         release_year DESC, 
         rental_rate DESC

#A note should also be made that MIN, MAX, and AVERAGE functions work the same as in excel for all integer based columns
